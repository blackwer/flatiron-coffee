# Flatiron Coffee Bot

Meet your colleagues from across the Institute!

## What's this all about?

This bot is designed to introduce you to new people from all across Flatiron by encouraging you to set up brief one-on-one coffee meetings with new colleagues each week.
The hope is that this will help identify common interests, foster new collaborations, and perhaps even start new friendships.
These types of programs have been successful in other companies and there are even some other open source options, but (in the Flatiron style) we decided to roll our own lightweight open source solution.


## How does it work?

When you sign up, your email address will be added to a pool and each week you'll receive an email connecting you with another employee from that pool.
This email will encourage you to arrange a short (think 15 minutes) informal meeting some time during the week.
These meetings can be over coffee on the 11th floor or another common space, but they shouldn't be scheduled in anyone's office.
You're absolutely welcome to ignore or postpone the meeting suggestion for any reason (if you're traveling or too busy, for example), but do try to let the other person know if you can't make it because you won't ever be paired again!

If you want to sign up, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczmH1bGbal7mdj1gAItsjgnkRetzYlb6dtcFrcsYY5W_dNVA) (you'll need to be signed in with your Foundation Google account) and you'll be added to this list.
The emails will be delivered from mailgun@mg.dfm.io.
Please get in touch if you have any issues, questions, comments, or concerns.
