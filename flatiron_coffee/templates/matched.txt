Dear {{name1}} and {{name2}},

This is an automated email from a robot that has paired you for a random
coffee meeting in the next two weeks. This program is designed to introduce
you to new people from all across Flatiron by encouraging you to set up
brief one-on-one coffee meetings with new colleagues each week. The hope is
that this will help identify common interests, foster new collaborations,
and perhaps even start new friendships.

This email is here to encourage you two to arrange a short (think 15
minutes) informal meeting some time in the next two weeks. These meetings
can be over coffee on the 11th floor or another common space, but they
shouldn't be in anyone's office.

You're welcome to ignore or postpone the meeting suggestion for any reason
(if you're traveling or too busy, for example), but do try to let each other
know if you can't make it because you won't ever be paired again!

You can opt out of this program here: {form_url}

Enjoy your coffee, tea, or similar!
