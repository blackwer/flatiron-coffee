Dear {{ name }},

This is an automated email from a robot. I could not find you a meeting
this week either because there was an odd number of sign ups or because
you have already been paired with all the other participants. I'll send
you a meeting suggestion as soon as I can!

You can opt out of this program here: https://forms.gle/2ZMLRgqZQsvupSVSA

Best,
The Flatiron Coffee Robot

PS Get in touch with Dan (dforeman-mackey@flatironinstitute.org) if you have
any questions or concerns.
