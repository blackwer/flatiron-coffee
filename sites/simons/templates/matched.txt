Dear {{name1}} and {{name2}},

Youâ€™re receiving this email because you signed up for Coffee Connections. This
is an automated email from a robot that has paired you for a random coffee
meeting in the next two weeks. This program is designed to introduce you to new
colleagues by encouraging you to set up brief one-on-one coffee meetings with a
new person every 2 weeks. The hope is that this will help identify common
interests, foster new collaborations, and perhaps even start friendships.

This email is here to encourage you two to arrange a short (think 15 minutes)
informal meeting sometime in the next two weeks. If you are both in the office
and both feel comfortable with it, feel free to arrange an in-person meeting.

You're welcome to decline or postpone the meeting suggestion for any reason, but
do try to let each other know if you can't make it because each unique pairing
only happens once!

You can opt out of this program here: {form_url}

Enjoy your coffee, tea, or similar!
