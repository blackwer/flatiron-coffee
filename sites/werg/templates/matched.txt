Dear {{name1}} and {{name2}},

This is an automated email from a robot that has paired you for a random
coffee meeting in the next two weeks. This program is designed to introduce
you to new colleagues by encouraging you to set up
brief one-on-one coffee meetings with a new person every 2 weeks. The hope is
that this will help identify common interests and start friendships.

This email is here to encourage you two to arrange a short (think 15 minutes)
informal meeting sometime in the next two weeks. If you are both in the office
and both feel comfortable with it, feel free to arrange an in-person meeting,
but make sure that you follow the recommended safety procedures!

You're welcome to decline or postpone the meeting suggestion for any reason, but
do try to let each other know if you can't make it because you won't ever be
paired again!

You can opt out of this program here: {form_url}

Enjoy your coffee, tea, or similar!
