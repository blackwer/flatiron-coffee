Dear {{name1}} and {{name2}},

This is an automated email from a robot that has paired you two for short (think
15 minutes) informal "coffee" meeting in the next two weeks. The hope is that
these chats between randomly paired CCQ scientists will help identify common
interests, foster new collaborations, and perhaps even start new friendships.

Please reach out to each other to set up a meeting. If you are both in the
office and both feel comfortable with it, feel free to arrange an in-person
meeting, but make sure that you follow the recommended safety procedures!

You're welcome to ignore or postpone the meeting for any reason but please do
let each other know if you can't make it.

Enjoy your coffee, tea, or similar!
